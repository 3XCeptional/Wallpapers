## ✨ Key Features

*   **Automated Organization**: Images are recursively scanned, de-duplicated using content hashes, and categorized.
*   **Structured by Attributes**: The collection is organized by orientation (Horizontal/Vertical), resolution (1080p, 2K, 4K+), and keyword tags.
*   **URL-Safe Naming**: All filenames have been sanitized by replacing special characters with underscores (`_`) to ensure compatibility and prevent broken links.
*   **Paginated Navigation**: The gallery is split into multiple Markdown pages for fast loading and convenient browsing.
